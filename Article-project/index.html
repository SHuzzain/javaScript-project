            <span>This immense mountain range began to form between 40 and 50 million years ago, 
              when two large landmasses, India and Eurasia, driven by plate movement, collided. Because both these continental landmasses have about the same rock density, 
              one plate could not be subducted under the other.</span>

              <span>Man has come a long way from the living style Nature had once designed for him. God gave him the Eden Garden to live in but he preferred to build concrete jungles instead. He took it as a victory over nature—a victory that brought him stress and strain of a hectic life. Here is The Himalayan Mountain Sojourns that offers you to take 
                into countryside settings denouncing hypocrisy and sham of moderns and bearing innocence, rusticity and humility of primitives.</span>

                <span>The highest mountain range on Earth, the Himalayas form the northern border of the Indian subcontinent in Asia. The mountains extend in a massive arc for about 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) from west to east with more than 30 peaks rising to heights greater than 24,000 feet (7,300 meters) above sea level. These include Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters), Kanchenjunga at 28,169 feet (8,586 meters), Makalu at 27,766 feet (8,463 meters), and Dhaulagiri at 26,795 feet (8,167 meters).</span>
